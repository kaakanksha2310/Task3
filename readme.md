## Project Overview

This project is a basic Node.js application structure following best practices for organizing files and folders. The repository includes a skeleton structure for models, controllers, routes, middleware, configuration, and other necessary components.


### Folder Structure:
- **`project-root/`**: The root directory of your project.
- **`config/`**: Stores configuration files such as database connections and environment variables.
- **`docs/`**: Contains project documentation.
- **`node_modules/`**: Automatically generated directory that stores dependencies installed by npm.
- **`public/`**: Publicly accessible static files like images, JavaScript, CSS files.
- **`src/`**: Contains the source code of your application.
  - **`controllers/`**: Functions that handle HTTP requests and responses.
  - **`middleware/`**: Custom middleware functions for your application.
  - **`models/`**: Database schemas and data models.
  - **`routes/`**: Defines the routes/endpoints for your application.
  - **`services/`**: Business logic and service functions.
- **`tests/`**: Contains unit and integration tests for the application.
- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
- **`package.json`**: Defines the project's metadata and dependencies.
- **`package-lock.json`**: Automatically generated file that locks the versions of the dependencies.
- **`readme.md`**: The project's documentation file.
- **`server.js`**: The main entry point of your Node.js application.

This structure makes it clear what each part of your project is for and will help others (and yourself) navigate the project easily.
